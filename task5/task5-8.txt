Q: Languages support multithreading ?


Many programming languages support multithreading, providing developers with the ability to create programs that can execute multiple threads concurrently within a single process.
 Some of the most popular programming languages that support multithreading are:

1. Java: Java has built-in support for multithreading using the Thread class and Runnable interface.

2. Python: Python's threading module provides an implementation of multithreading.

3. C#: C# has built-in support for multithreading using the Thread class, Parallel class, and Task Parallel Library.

4. C++: C++ supports multithreading through the use of various threading libraries such as Pthreads, Boost.Thread, and C++11's thread library.

5. Ruby: Ruby provides support for multithreading through its Thread class.

6. Swift: Swift has built-in support for multithreading using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD).

7. Go: Go programming language provides native support for concurrent programming through Goroutines and Channels.

8. PHP: PHP supports multithreading using POSIX threads (Pthreads) extension.

9. JavaScript: JavaScript supports multithreading via the Web Workers API.

In conclusion, many programming languages support multithreading,
providing developers with the ability to create highly concurrent programs that can execute multiple independent threads of execution.
Developers can choose the programming language that best suits their specific application requirements.
