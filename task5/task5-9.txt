Q: Clean Code principles?


Clean Code is a set of principles and best practices intended for writing readable, efficient, and maintainable code. The fundamental principles of Clean Code are:

1. Keep the Code Simple: A Clean Code should be easy to read and understand, with fewer lines of code and minimum complexity.

2. Naming Conventions: Naming conventions should be clear, precise, and expressive.

3. Proper Formatting: Formatting should be consistent and well-organized.

4. Less is more: Function should be small and focused to have fewer dependencies and easy to test.

5. Comments: Code should be expressive and easy to read without relying on comments, but if necessary, comments should be clear and concise.

6. DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself): Duplication should be avoided, and code should be written in a way that minimizes repetition of code.

7. SOLID: SOLID stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, 
and Dependency Inversion Principle. Following these principles helps to build modular, reusable, and extendable code.

8. Error Handling: Error handling should be done properly, and exceptions should be used to handle errors.

9. Testing: Unit testing should be performed to ensure that code is working as expected.

10. Continuous Refactoring: Ongoing maintenance and refactoring should be performed to keep the code clean, updated, and maintainable.

In conclusion, Clean Code principles are guidelines for writing readable, efficient, and maintainable code, 
which ultimately leads to better software development and fewer bugs. By following these principles, developers can improve code quality, reduce complexity,
increase productivity, and make the code more readable and scalable.
