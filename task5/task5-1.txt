Q: two basic ways of computer architecture, and which one is the best?

The two basic ways of computer architecture are the von Neumann architecture and the Harvard architecture.

The von Neumann architecture allows programs and data to be stored in the same memory space, which is accessible by the CPU.
 
In contrast, the Harvard architecture uses separate memory spaces for programs and data, with different buses for each.

There is no one "best" architecture as it depends on the specific requirements of the system.
The von Neumann architecture is more flexible and easier to implement, making it more common in modern computers. 
On the other hand, 
the Harvard architecture is more efficient for systems that require high-speed access to both program and data memory simultaneously,
 such as digital signal processing or embedded systems.
