Q: What's RPA and it's tools?

RPA, or Robotic Process Automation, 
is a software technology that enables the automation of repetitive tasks and processes in a business using software robots or bots.
 These tools are designed to mimic and automate human actions and interactions within digital systems, user interfaces and applications. 
Some common RPA tools include UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, WorkFusion, and Kofax.
These tools can perform various tasks such as data entry, form filling, 
screen scraping, report generation, 
and rule-based decision making, among others.
