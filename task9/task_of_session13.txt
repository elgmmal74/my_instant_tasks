Q1 What is non-probability sampling methods?

Non-probability sampling methods are a set of techniques used in research to select participants or units for a study without involving random selection. 
Unlike probability sampling, where each member of the population has a known probability of being included in the sample, 
non-probability sampling methods do not guarantee that every individual or unit in the population has an equal chance of being selected. 
Here are some common non-probability sampling methods:

Convenience Sampling: This method involves selecting participants who are readily available and accessible to the researcher. 

Convenience sampling is convenient but may introduce bias since it relies on the ease of access rather than random selection.

Purposive Sampling: In purposive sampling, researchers deliberately select participants who possess specific characteristics or meet certain criteria relevant to the research question. 
This method allows researchers to target individuals who are knowledgeable or experienced in the area of interest. 
However, it can introduce bias if the chosen participants do not represent the wider population accurately.

Snowball Sampling: Snowball sampling involves identifying initial participants and then asking them to refer other potential participants. 
This method is useful when the target population is difficult to reach, such as marginalized or hidden populations. 
It relies on social networks and referrals but may introduce bias since participants are not randomly selected.

Quota Sampling: Quota sampling involves setting specific quotas or predetermined targets for different subgroups within the population. 
Researchers select participants to meet these quotas based on characteristics like age, gender, or ethnicity. 

Quota sampling provides some control over the composition of the sample but does not ensure random selection.

Expert Sampling: Expert sampling involves selecting participants who are considered experts or have specialized knowledge in a particular field. 
This method is commonly used in qualitative research or when studying a niche topic. 
However, it may introduce bias since participants are chosen based on their expertise rather than random selection

Q2 Types of data distribution and types of density function?


In statistics, data distribution refers to the pattern or arrangement of values in a dataset.
 There are several types of data distributions, each characterized by different properties. Here are some commonly encountered data distributions:

Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution): The normal distribution is symmetrical, bell-shaped, and characterized by its mean and standard deviation. Many variables in nature and social sciences tend to follow a normal distribution. The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is given by the bell-shaped curve known as the Gaussian curve.

Uniform Distribution: In a uniform distribution, all values in a dataset have equal probability of occurrence. 
It is characterized by a constant probability density and a rectangular shape.
 An example of a uniform distribution is rolling a fair die, where each face has an equal chance of appearing.

Skewed Distribution: Skewed distributions are asymmetrical and have a tail that extends more to one side than the other. 
There are two types of skewed distributions:

Positively Skewed (Right-skewed): The tail of the distribution extends towards the right, and the majority of the values are concentrated on the left side.
Negatively Skewed (Left-skewed): The tail of the distribution extends towards the left, and the majority of the values are concentrated on the right side.
Exponential Distribution: The exponential distribution describes the time between events in a Poisson process, 
where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. 
It is characterized by a decreasing exponential shape and is commonly used to model waiting times or durations.

Log-Normal Distribution: The log-normal distribution is a skewed distribution where the logarithm of the values follows a normal distribution.
 It is often used to model variables that are positively skewed on the original scale, such as income or stock prices.

Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space. 
It is characterized by discrete values and is often used to model rare events, such as the number of phone calls received at a call center within a specific time frame.

These are just a few examples of data distributions commonly encountered in statistics. There are many other distributions, each with its own characteristics and applications.

Regarding density functions, a density function (also called a probability density function or PDF) describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. 
Here are a few types of density functions:

Gaussian (Normal) Density Function: The Gaussian density function is associated with the normal distribution and is characterized by the bell-shaped curve.

Uniform Density Function: The uniform density function has a constant value within a specific interval and is used to represent a uniform distribution.

Exponential Density Function: The exponential density function describes the exponential distribution and is characterized by a decreasing exponential shape.

-Beta Density Function: The beta density function is commonly used to model probabilities or proportions and is characterized by its shape, which can be symmetric or skewed.

-Gamma Density Function: The gamma density function is used to model continuous positive variables and is often used in areas such as queuing theory or reliability analysis.

These are just a few examples of density functions. There are many other types of density functions, 
each associated with specific probability distributions and used in various fields of study.
